# Copy only the project and solution files first. This allows Docker to cache the
# restored packages layer. The download will only re-run if these files change.
# IMPORTANT: This assumes your project is named 'user.csproj' and is in the root
# of the build context. Adjust the filename if it's different.

# This will create user.dll and its dependencies in the /app folder.
